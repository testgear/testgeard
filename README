=== Test Gear device server (testgeard) ===


1. Introduction

    This is the Test Gear device server which manages incoming connections and
    handles incoming requests to load/unload test plugins, query/manage various
    test variables, and run test commands.

    Each test plugin offers various parameters (variables) and commands
    (functions) which can be queried or fired from the Test Gear client.

    It is part of the Test Gear project which aims to create a simple hardware
    test framework for use with any type of GNU/Linux based system.


2. Status

    The code is currently considered highly experimental. API and internals are
    subject to change. Use on your own risk. For now, consider it a playground
    for experiments.


3. Development

    This is open source. If you want to help out with the project please join
    in. Any contributions (code, doc, ideas, etc.) are welcome.
